Simple Physics Engine
=====================

This is a simple physics engine that I wrote in Python. It uses openGL for rendering and Pygame for input handling. The engine is capable of simulating rigid body dynamics, and can handle collisions between rigid bodies. The engine is also capable of simulating the effects of gravity and friction.
